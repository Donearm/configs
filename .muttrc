 set abort_nosubject=ask-yes
#
# Name: abort_nosubject
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is given
# at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to
# no, composing messages with no subject given at the subject
# prompt will never be aborted.
# 
# 
# set abort_unmodified=yes
#
# Name: abort_unmodified
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set to yes, composition will automatically abort after
# editing the message body if no changes are made to the file (this
# check only happens after the first edit of the file).  When set
# to no, composition will never be aborted.
# 
# 
 set alias_file="~/.muttrc_alias"
 source ~/.muttrc_alias
#
# Name: alias_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.muttrc"
# 
# 
# The default file in which to save aliases created by the 
# ``create-alias'' function.
# 
# Note: Mutt will not automatically source this file; you must
# explicitly use the ``source'' command for it to be executed.
# 
# 
 set alias_format="%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r"
#
# Name: alias_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r"
# 
# 
# Specifies the format of the data displayed for the `alias' menu.  The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
# 
# %a      alias name
# %f      flags - currently, a "d" for an alias marked for deletion
# %n      index number
# %r      address which alias expands to
# %t      character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion
# 
# 
 set allow_8bit=yes
#
# Name: allow_8bit
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either Quoted-
# Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.
# 
# 
# set allow_ansi=no
#
# Name: allow_ansi
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in 
# rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
# Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
# their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
# your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
# message could include a line like "[-- PGP output follows ..." and
# give it the same color as your attachment color.
# 
# 
alternates     ^(me1|me2)@gmail\\.com$ ^otheraccount@somewhere\\.net$
#
# Name: alternates
# Type: regular expression
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# A regexp that allows you to specify alternate addresses where
# you receive mail.  This affects Mutt's idea about messages from you
# and addressed to you.
# 
# 
# set arrow_cursor=yes
#
# Name: arrow_cursor
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, an arrow (``->'') will be used to indicate the current entry
# in menus instead of hiliting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
# links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
# be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
# in the menu.
# 
# 
# set ascii_chars=no
#
# Name: ascii_chars
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#

# If set, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
# and attachment trees, instead of the default ACS characters.
# 
# 
 set askbcc=no
#
# Name: askbcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients
# before editing an outgoing message.
# 
#

#
# Name: askcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#

#
# Name: attach_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%> [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] "
# 
# 
# This variable describes the format of the `attachment' menu.  The
# following printf-style sequences are understood:
# 
# %D      deleted flag
# %d      description
# %e      MIME content-transfer-encoding
# %f      filename
# %I      disposition (I=inline, A=attachment)

# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# 
# 
# set attach_sep="\n"
#
# Name: attach_sep
# Type: string
# Default: "\n"
# 
# 
# The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
# printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.
# 
# 
 set attach_split=yes
#
# Name: attach_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
# etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt will concatenate the
# attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
# ``$attach_sep'' separator is added after each attachment. When set,
# Mutt will operate on the attachments one by one.
# 
# 
 set attribution="* %d, %n wrote:"
#
# Name: attribution
# Type: string
# Default: "On %d, %n wrote:"
# 
# 
# This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
# in a reply.  For a full listing of defined printf()-like sequences see
# the section on ``$index_format''.
# 
# 
 set autoedit=yes
#
# Name: autoedit
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set along with ``$edit_headers'', Mutt will skip the initial
# send-menu and allow you to immediately begin editing the body of your
# message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
# editing the body of your message.
# 
# Also see ``$fast_reply''.
# 
# 
# set auto_tag=no
#
# Name: auto_tag
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, functions in the index menu which affect a message
# will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
# unset, you must first use the tag-prefix function (default: ";") to
# make the next function apply to all tagged messages.
# 
# 
# set beep=yes
#
# Name: beep
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error occurs.
# 
# 
# set beep_new=no
#
# Name: beep_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep whenever it prints a message
# notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
# ``$beep'' variable.
# 
# 
 set bounce_delivered=yes
#
# Name: bounce_delivered
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will include Delivered-To headers when
# bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to unset this variable.
# 
# 
# set charset="iso-8859-15"	    #"it_IT@euro"

# 
# set check_new=yes
#
# Name: check_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style
# mailboxes.
# 
# When set, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while the
# mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
# take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
# checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
# check_new is unset, no check for new mail is performed
# while the mailbox is open.
# 
# 
# set collapse_unread=yes
#
# Name: collapse_unread
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
# unread messages.
# 
# 
# set uncollapse_jump=no
#
# Name: uncollapse_jump
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
# when the current thread is uncollapsed.
# 
# 
# set compose_format="-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
#
# Name: compose_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
# 
# 
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the \fCompose
# menu.  This string is similar to ``$status_format'', but has its own
# set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %a      total number of attachments 
# %h      local hostname
# %l      approximate size (in bytes) of the current message
# %v      Mutt version string
# 
# 
# See the text describing the ``$status_format'' option for more 
# information on how to set ``$compose_format''.
# 
# 
# set confirmappend=yes
#
# Name: confirmappend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to
# an existing mailbox.
# 
# 
 set confirmcreate=no
#
# Name: confirmcreate
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a
# mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.
# 
# 
# set connect_timeout=30
#
# Name: connect_timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 30
# 
# 
# Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP or POP) after this
# many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
# value causes Mutt to wait indefinitely for the connection to succeed.
# 
# 
 set copy=yes
#
# Name: copy
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages
# will be saved for later references.  Also see ``$record'',
# ``$save_name'', ``$force_name'' and ``fcc-hook''.
# 
# 
 set date_format="%a %d %b, %Y at %H:%M:%S %Z"
#
# Name: date_format
# Type: string
# Default: "!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the format of the date printed by the ``%d''
# sequence in ``$index_format''.  This is passed to the strftime
# call to process the date. See the man page for strftime(3) for
# the proper syntax.
# 
# Unless the first character in the string is a bang (``!''), the month
# and week day names are expanded according to the locale specified in
# the variable ``$locale''. If the first character in the string is a
# bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
# rest of the string are expanded in the C locale (that is in US
# English).
# 
# 
# set default_hook="~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
#
# Name: default_hook
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
# 
# 
# This variable controls how send-hooks, message-hooks, save-hooks,
# and fcc-hooks will
# be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp,
# instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
# declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
# variable at the time the hook is declared.  The default value matches
# if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
# given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
# ``$alternates'') and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
# regular expression.
# 
# 
 set delete=ask-yes
#
# Name: delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not messages are really deleted when closing or
# synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to yes, messages marked for
# deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.  If set to
# no, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.
# 
# 
# set delete_untag=yes
#
# Name: delete_untag
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this option is set, mutt will untag messages when marking them
# for deletion.  This applies when you either explicitly delete a message,
# or when you save it to another folder.
# 
# 
# set digest_collapse=yes
#
# Name: digest_collapse
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this option is set, mutt's revattach menu will not show the subparts of
# individual messages in a digest.  To see these subparts, press 'v' on that menu.
# 
# 
# set display_filter="tr '\\221\\222\\223\\224\\226''\\047\\047\\042\\042\\055'"
#
# Name: display_filter
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
# is viewed it is passed as standard input to $display_filter, and the
# filtered message is read from the standard output.
# 
# 
# set dotlock_program="/usr/bin/mutt_dotlock"
#
# Name: dotlock_program
# Type: path
# Default: "/usr/bin/mutt_dotlock"
# 
# 
# Contains the path of the mutt_dotlock (8) binary to be used by
# mutt.
# 
# 
 set dsn_notify="failure,delay"
#
# Name: dsn_notify
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Note: you should not enable this unless you are using Sendmail
# 8.8.x or greater.
# 
# This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
# string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
# of the following: never, to never request notification,
# failure, to request notification on transmission failure,
# delay, to be notified of message delays, success, to be
# notified of successful transmission.
# 
# Example: set dsn_notify="failure,delay"
# 
# 
 set dsn_return="hdrs"
#
# Name: dsn_return
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Note: you should not enable this unless you are using Sendmail
# 8.8.x or greater.
# 
# This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN
# messages.  It may be set to either hdrs to return just the
# message header, or full to return the full message.
# 
# Example: set dsn_return=hdrs
# 
# 
# set duplicate_threads=yes
#
# Name: duplicate_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether mutt, when sorting by threads, threads
# messages with the same message-id together.  If it is set, it will indicate
# that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an equals sign
# in the thread diagram.
# 
# 
 set edit_headers=yes
#
# Name: edit_headers
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages
# along with the body of your message.
# 
#
 set editor="vim -c 'set tw=72 et' \
 -c 'set fo=tcrq' \
 -c 'set syntax=mail' \
 -c ':0;/^To: '\
 -c 'set spell'\
 -c 'set nobackup'"

# set editor="vim"
# set editor="vim -c 'silent! %%s/\%(^[ >]*>\)\@<= *>/>/ge'"
 
#
# Name: editor
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which editor is used by mutt.
# It defaults to the value of the VISUAL, or EDITOR, environment
# variable, or to the string "vi" if neither of those are set.
# 
# 
# set encode_from=no
#
# Name: encode_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages when
# they contain the string "From " in the beginning of a line.
# Useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
# agents tend to do with messages.
# 
# 
# set envelope_from=no
#
# Name: envelope_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will try to derive the message's envelope
# sender from the "From:" header.  Note that this information is passed 
# to sendmail command using the "-f" command line switch, so don't set this
# option if you are using that switch in $sendmail yourself,
# or if the sendmail on your machine doesn't support that command
# line switch.
# 
# 
# set escape="~"
#
# Name: escape
# Type: string
# Default: "~"
# 
# 
# Escape character to use for functions in the builtin editor.
# 
# 
# set fast_reply=no
#
# Name: fast_reply
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped
# when replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is
# skipped when forwarding messages.
# 
# Note: this variable has no effect when the ``$autoedit''
# variable is set.
# 
# 
# set fcc_attach=yes
#
# Name: fcc_attach
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages
# are saved along with the main body of your message.
# 
# 
# set fcc_clear=no
#
# Name: fcc_clear
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and
# unsigned, even when the actual message is encrypted and/or signed.
# 
# 
 set folder="$HOME/Maildir/"
#
# Name: folder
# Type: path
# Default: "~/Mail"
# 
# 
# Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A `+' or `=' at the
# beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of this
# variable.  Note that if you change this variable from the default
# value you need to make sure that the assignment occurs before
# you use `+' or `=' for any other variables since expansion takes place
# during the `set' command.
# 
# 
set folder_format="%2C %t %N %f"
#
# Name: folder_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the file browser display to your
# personal taste.  This string is similar to ``$index_format'', but has
# its own set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %C      current file number
# %d      date/time folder was last modified
# %f      filename
# %F      file permissions
# %g      group name (or numeric gid, if missing)
# %l      number of hard links
# %N      N if folder has new mail, blank otherwise
# %s      size in bytes
# %t      * if the file is tagged, blank otherwise
# %u      owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# 
# 
# set followup_to=yes
#
# Name: followup_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not the Mail-Followup-To header field is
# generated when sending mail.  When set, Mutt will generate this
# field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
# the ``subscribe'' or ``lists'' commands.
# 
# This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from receiving
# duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send to mailing
# lists.  Second, ensuring that you do get a reply separately for any
# messages sent to known lists to which you are not subscribed.  The
# header will contain only the list's address for subscribed lists,
# and both the list address and your own email address for unsubscribed
# lists.  Without this header, a group reply to your message sent to a
# subscribed list will be sent to both the list and your address,
# resulting in two copies of the same email for you.
# 
# 
# set force_name=no
#
# Name: force_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable is similar to ``$save_name'', except that Mutt will
# store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
# you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.
# 
# Also see the ``$record'' variable.
# 
# 
# set forward_decode=yes
#
# Name: forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message.  The message header is also RFC2047 decoded.
# This variable is only used, if ``$mime_forward'' is unset,
# otherwise ``$mime_forward_decode'' is used instead.
# 
# 
# set forward_format="[%a: %s]"
#
# Name: forward_format
# Type: string
# Default: "[%a: %s]"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
# It uses the same format sequences as the ``$index_format'' variable.
# 
# 
# set forward_quote=no
#
# Name: forward_quote
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set forwarded messages included in the main body of the

# 
# 
# set from="forod.g@gmail.com"
#
# Name: from
# Type: e-mail address
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When set, this variable contains a default from address.  It
# can be overridden using my_hdr (including from send-hooks) and
# ``$reverse_name''.
# 
# Defaults to the EMAIL environment variable's content.
# 
# 
# set gecos_mask="^[^,]*"
#
# Name: gecos_mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^[^,]*"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
# entry when expanding the alias.  By default the regular expression is set
# to "^[^,]*" which will return the string up to the first "," encountered.
# If the GECOS field contains a string like "lastname, firstname" then you
# should set the gecos_mask=".*".
# 
# This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address a e-mail
# to user ID stevef whose full name is Steve Franklin.  If mutt expands 
# stevef to "Franklin" stevef@foo.bar then you should set the gecos_mask to
# a regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt will expand
# "Franklin" to "Franklin, Steve".
# 
# 
 set hdrs=yes
#
# Name: hdrs
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, the header fields normally added by the ``my_hdr''

# of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
# The ``$weed'' setting applies.
# 
# 
 set help=yes
#
# Name: help
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
# provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
# 
# Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
# function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
# the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is
# running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
# of these should present a major problem.
# 
# 
# set hidden_host=no
#
# Name: hidden_host
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will skip the host name part of ``$hostname'' variable
# when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
# affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the 
# cut-off of first-level domains.
# 
# 
# set hide_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the

# 
# 
# set hide_top_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_top_missing

# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden

# 
# 
 set history=20
#
# Name: history
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of

# variable is set.
# 
# 
# set honor_followup_to=yes
#
# Name: honor_followup_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
# honored when group-replying to a message.
# 
# 
 set hostname="`hostname`.PINGUINO"
#
# Name: hostname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the hostname to use after the ``@'' in local e-mail
# addresses.  This overrides the compile time definition obtained from
# /etc/resolv.conf.
# 
# 
 set ignore_list_reply_to=yes
#
# Name: ignore_list_reply_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Affects the behaviour of the reply function when replying to
# messages from mailing lists.  When set, if the ``Reply-To:'' field is
# set to the same value as the ``To:'' field, Mutt assumes that the
# ``Reply-To:'' field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
# to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
# mailing list when this option is set, use the list-reply
# function; group-reply will reply to both the sender and the
# list.
# 
# 
 set imap_authenticators="login"
#
# Name: imap_authenticators
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are either 'login' or the right
# side of an IMAP 'AUTH=xxx' capability string, eg 'digest-md5',
# 'gssapi' or 'cram-md5'. This parameter is case-insensitive. If this
# parameter is unset (the default) mutt will try all available methods,
# in order from most-secure to least-secure.
# 
# Example: set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram-md5:login"
# 
# Note: Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
# the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
# authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.
# 
# 
# set imap_delim_chars="/."
#
# Name: imap_delim_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "/."
# 
# 
# This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat
# as folder separators for displaying IMAP paths. In particular it
# helps in using the '=' shortcut for your folder variable.
# 
# 
# set imap_force_ssl=no
#
# Name: imap_force_ssl
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If this variable is set, Mutt will always use SSL when
# connecting to IMAP servers.
# 
# 
# set imap_home_namespace=""
#
# Name: imap_home_namespace
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# You normally want to see your personal folders alongside
# your INBOX in the IMAP browser. If you see something else, you may set
# this variable to the IMAP path to your folders.
# 
# 
# set imap_keepalive=900
#
# Name: imap_keepalive
# Type: number
# Default: 900
# 
# 
# This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that mutt
# will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
# from closing them before mutt has finished with them. The default is
# well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
# a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
# violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
# getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.
# 
# 
# set imap_list_subscribed=no
#
# Name: imap_list_subscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
# only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
# IMAP browser with the toggle-subscribed function.
# 
# 
#set imap_pass=""
#
# Name: imap_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, Mutt will
# prompt you for your password when you invoke the fetch-mail function.
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even
# if you are the only one who can read the file.
# 
# 
 set imap_passive=yes
#
# Name: imap_passive
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
# mail.  Mutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
# connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted to
# user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or if opening the connection
# is slow.
# 
# 
 set imap_peek=yes
#
# Name: imap_peek
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
# you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
# but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
# exists to appease speed freaks.
# 
# 
# set imap_servernoise=yes
#
# Name: imap_servernoise
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
# server as error messages. Since these messages are often
# harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
# server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
# them at some point.
# 
# 
# set imap_user=""
#
# Name: imap_user
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Your login name on the IMAP server.
# 
# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
# 
# 
# set implicit_autoview=yes
#
# Name: implicit_autoview
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set to ``yes'', mutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
# copiousoutput flag set for every MIME attachment it doesn't have
# an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, mutt will
# use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
# form.
# 
# 
 set include=ask-yes
#
# Name: include
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to
# is included in your reply.
# 
# 
 set indent_string="> "
#
# Name: indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: "> "
# 
# 
# Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
# message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
# change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.
# 
# 
# set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-10.10F %-20.20L (%4c) %s"
#
# Name: index_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%4l) %s"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
# your personal taste.
# 
# ``Format strings'' are similar to the strings used in the ``C''
# function printf to format output (see the man page for more detail).
# The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
# 
# %a      address of the author

# 
 set locale="it_IT.ISO-8859-15"
#
# Name: locale
# Type: string
# Default: "C"

# 
# 
# set mail_check=5
#
# Name: mail_check
# Type: number
# Default: 5

# 
# 
# set mailcap_sanitize=yes
#
# Name: mailcap_sanitize
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos
# to a well-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting,
# but we are not sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.
# 
# DON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE
# DOING!
# 
# 
# set maildir_trash=no
#
# Name: maildir_trash
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir
# (T)rashed flag instead of unlinked.  NOTE: this only applies
# to maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
# mailbox types.
# 
# 
 set mark_old=no
#
# Name: mark_old
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt makes the distinction between new
# messages and old unread messages.  By default, Mutt will
# mark new messages as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
# The next time you start Mutt, the messages will show up with an "O"
# next to them in the index menu, indicating that they are old.  In
# order to make Mutt treat all unread messages as new only, you can
# unset this variable.
# 
# 
 set markers=no
#
# Name: markers
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a

# 
# This specifies the folder into which read mail in your ``$spoolfile''
# folder will be appended.
# 
# 
 set mbox_type=Maildir
#
# Name: mbox_type
# Type: folder magic

# variable) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.
# 
# 
# set menu_scroll=no
#
# Name: menu_scroll
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
# attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If unset, the screen
# is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
# (useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).
# 
# 
# set meta_key=no
#
# Name: meta_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
# set as if the user had pressed the ESC key and whatever key remains
# after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
# has an ASCII value of 0xf4, then this is treated as if the user had
# pressed ESC then ``x''.  This is because the result of removing the
# high bit from ``0xf4'' is ``0x74'', which is the ASCII character
# ``x''.
# 
# 
# set mh_purge=no
#
# Name: mh_purge
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When unset, mutt will mimic mh's behaviour and rename deleted messages

# them.  If the variable is set, the message files will simply be
# deleted.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_flagged="flagged"

# Name: mh_seq_unseen
# Type: string
# Default: "unseen"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.
# 
# 
 set mime_forward=yes
#
# Name: mime_forward
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
# separate MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
# message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
# can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
# to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
# variable to ask-no or ask-yes.
# 
# Also see ``$forward_decode'' and ``$mime_forward_decode''.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward_decode=no
#
# Name: mime_forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when

# ``$forward_decode'' is used instead.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward_rest=yes
#
# Name: mime_forward_rest
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the recvattach
# menu, attachments which cannot be decoded in a reasonable manner will
# be attached to the newly composed message if this option is set.
# 
# 
# set mix_entry_format="%4n %c %-16s %a"

# Name: mix_entry_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %c %-16s %a"

# 
# This variable describes the format of a remailer line on the mixmaster
# chain selection screen.  The following printf-like sequences are 
# supported:
# 
# %n      The running number on the menu.
# %c      Remailer capabilities.
# %s      The remailer's short name.
# %a      The remailer's e-mail address.
# 
# 
# set mixmaster="mixmaster"
#
# Name: mixmaster
# Type: path
# Default: "mixmaster"
# 
# 
# This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster binary on your
# system.  It is used with various sets of parameters to gather the
# list of known remailers, and to finally send a message through the
# mixmaster chain.
# 
# 
# set move=ask-no
#
# Name: move
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
# 
# 
# Controls whether you will be asked to confirm moving read messages

# 
# 
# set message_format="%s"
#
# Name: message_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%s"
# 
# 
# This is the string displayed in the ``attachment'' menu for

# printf()-like sequences see the section on ``$index_format''.
# 
# 
# set pager="builtin"
#
# Name: pager
# Type: path
# Default: "builtin"
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
# messages.  builtin means to use the builtin pager, otherwise this
# variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
# like to use.
# 
# Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional
# keystrokes are necessary because you can't call mutt functions
# directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer than
# the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.
# 
# 
 set pager_context=2
#
# Name: pager_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
# when displaying the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By
# default, Mutt will display the line after the last one on the screen
# at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).
#

# section.
# 
# 
 set pager_index_lines=2
#
# Name: pager_index_lines
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
# the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
# folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
# giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
# message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
# remain to be read in the current thread.  One of the lines is reserved
# for the status bar from the index, so a pager_index_lines of 6
# will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value of 0 results in
# no index being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder
# is less than pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as
# many lines as it needs.
# 
# 
 set pager_stop=yes
#
# Name: pager_stop
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the internal-pager will not move to the next message
# when you are at the end of a message and invoke the next-page
# function.
# 
# 
# set pgp_autosign=no
#
# Name: pgp_autosign
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP/MIME
# sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp-
# menu, when signing is not required or encryption is requested as
# well.
# 
# 
# set pgp_autoencrypt=no
#
# Name: pgp_autoencrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP/MIME
# encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in connection
# to the send-hook command.  It can be overridden by use of the
# pgp-menu, when encryption is not required or signing is
# requested as well.
# 
# 
# set pgp_ignore_subkeys=yes
#
# Name: pgp_ignore_subkeys
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to ignore OpenPGP subkeys. Instead,
# the principal key will inherit the subkeys' capabilities.  Unset this
# if you want to play interesting key selection games.
# 
# 
 set pgp_entry_format="%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u"
#
# Name: pgp_entry_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the PGP key selection menu to
# your personal taste. This string is similar to ``$index_format'', but
# has its own set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %n      number
# %k      key id
# %u      user id
# %a      algorithm
# %l      key length
# %f      flags

# set pgp_replysignencrypted=no
#
# Name: pgp_replysignencrypted
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP sign replies to messages which are
# encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
# ``$pgp_replyencrypt'', because it allows you to sign all messages
# which are automatically encrypted.  This works around the problem
# noted in ``$pgp_replysign'', that mutt is not able to find out
# whether an encrypted message is also signed.
# 
# 
# set pgp_retainable_sigs=no
#
# Name: pgp_retainable_sigs
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, signed and encrypted messages will consist of nested

# Name: pgp_sign_as
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If you have more than one key pair, this option allows you to specify

# 
 set pgp_strict_enc=yes
#
# Name: pgp_strict_enc
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as

# This format strings specifies a command which is used to decode 
# application/pgp attachments.
# 
# The PGP command formats have their own set of printf-like sequences:
# 
# %p      Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to an empty

#
# Name: reply_regexp
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^(re([\\[0-9\\]+])*|aw):[ \t]*"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading
# and replying. The default value corresponds to the English "Re:" and
# the German "Aw:".
# 
# 
# set reply_self=no
#
# Name: reply_self
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt will
# assume that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather
# than to yourself.
# 
# 
 set reply_to=ask-yes
#
# Name: reply_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will ask you if you want to use the address listed in the
# Reply-To: header field when replying to a message.  If you answer no,
# it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
# option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
# header field to the list address and you want to send a private
# message to the author of a message.
# 
# 
# set resolve=yes
#
# Name: resolve
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
# (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the
# current message is executed.
# 
# 
 set reverse_alias=yes
#
# Name: reverse_alias
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the "personal"
# name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
# matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
# alias:
# 
# alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)
# 
# and then you receive mail which contains the following header:
# 
# From: abd30425@somewhere.net
# 
# It would be displayed in the index menu as ``Joe User'' instead of
# ``abd30425@somewhere.net.''  This is useful when the person's e-mail
# address is not human friendly (like CompuServe addresses).
# 
# 
 set reverse_name=yes
#
# Name: reverse_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
# move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
# from there.  If this variable is set, the default From: line of
# the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
# messages you are replying to.  If the variable is unset, the
# From: line will use your address on the current machine.
# 
# 
 set reverse_realname=yes
#
# Name: reverse_realname
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable fine-tunes the behaviour of the reverse_name feature.
# When it is set, mutt will use the address from incoming messages as-is,
# possibly including eventual real names.  When it is unset, mutt will
# override any such realnames with the setting of the realname variable.
# 
# 
# set rfc2047_parameters=no
#
# Name: rfc2047_parameters
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, Mutt will decode RFC-2047-encoded MIME 
# parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt suggests you
# to save attachments to files named like this: 
# =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
# 
# When this variable is set interactively, the change doesn't have
# the desired effect before you have changed folders.
# 
# Note that this use of RFC 2047's encoding is explicitly,
# prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
# wild.
# Also note that setting this parameter will not have the effect 
# that mutt generates this kind of encoding.  Instead, mutt will
# unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC 2231.
# 
# 
# set save_address=no
#
# Name: save_address
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
# default folder for saving a mail. If ``$save_name'' or ``$force_name''
# is set too, the selection of the fcc folder will be changed as well.
# 
# 
# set save_empty=yes
#
# Name: save_empty
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
# when closed (the exception is ``$spoolfile'' which is never removed).
# If set, mailboxes are never removed.
# 
# Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt does not
# delete MH and Maildir directories.
# 
# 
# set save_name=no
#
# Name: save_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
# When set, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
# recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
# the ``$folder'' directory with the username part of the
# recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
# be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
# ``$record'' mailbox.
# 
# Also see the ``$force_name'' variable.
# 
# 
# set score=yes
#
# Name: score
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off.  This can
# be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
# ``$score_threshold_delete'' variable and friends are used.
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_delete=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_delete
# Type: number
# Default: -1
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by mutt.  Since
# mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_flag=9999
#
# Name: score_threshold_flag
# Type: number
# Default: 9999
# 
# 
# Messages wich have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this 
# variable's value are automatically marked "flagged".
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_read=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_read
# Type: number
# Default: -1
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked as read by mutt.  Since
# mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message read.
# 
# 
 set send_charset="utf-8:iso-8859-1:iso-8859-15:us-ascii"
#
# Name: send_charset
# Type: string
# Default: "us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"
# 
# 
# A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the
# first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
# If your ``$charset'' is not iso-8859-1 and recipients may not
# understand UTF-8, it is advisable to include in the list an
# appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
# iso-8859-2, koi8-r or iso-2022-jp) either instead of or after
# "iso-8859-1".
# 
#
 set sendmail="/usr/sbin/sendmail" 
# set sendmail="/var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject"
#
# Name: sendmail
# Type: path
# Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"
# 
# 
# Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt.
# Mutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
# arguments as recipient addresses.
# 
# 
# set sendmail_wait=0
#
# Name: sendmail_wait
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the ``$sendmail'' process
# to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.
# 
# Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
# >0      number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
# 0       wait forever for sendmail to finish
# <0      always put sendmail in the background without waiting
# 
# 
# Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child
# process will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you
# will be informed as to where to find the output.
# 
# 
# set shell=""
#
# Name: shell
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Command to use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user's login
# shell from /etc/passwd is used.
# 
# 
# set sig_dashes=yes
#
# Name: sig_dashes
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, a line containing ``-- '' will be inserted before your
# ``$signature''.  It is strongly recommended that you not unset
# this variable unless your ``signature'' contains just your name.  The
# reason for this is because many software packages use ``-- \n'' to
# detect your signature.  For example, Mutt has the ability to highlight
# the signature in a different color in the builtin pager.
# 
# 
# set sig_on_top=no
#
# Name: sig_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
# text.  It is strongly recommended that you do not set this variable
# unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
# some heat from netiquette guardians.
# 
# 
 set signature="~/.signature"
#
# Name: signature
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.signature"
# 
# 
# Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
# outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is
# assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
# its stdout.
# 
# 
# set simple_search="~f %s | ~s %s"
#
# Name: simple_search
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s | ~s %s"
# 
# 
# Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a real search
# pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the ~
# operators.  See ``patterns'' for more information on search patterns.
# 
# For example, if you simply type joe at a search or limit prompt, Mutt
# will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable.
# For the default value it would be:
# 
# ~f joe | ~s joe
# 
# 
 set smart_wrap=yes
#
# Name: smart_wrap
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the display of lines longer then the screen width in the
# internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If
# unset, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
# ``$markers'' variable.
# 
# 
# set smileys="(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
#
# Name: smileys
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
# 
# 
# The pager uses this variable to catch some common false
# positives of ``$quote_regexp'', most notably smileys in the beginning
# of a line
# 
# 
# set sleep_time=1
#
# Name: sleep_time
# Type: number
# Default: 1
# 
# 
# Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
# messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging
# messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so 
# a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.
# 
# 
 set sort=date
#
# Name: sort
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
# 
# 
# Specifies how to sort messages in the index menu.  Valid values
# are:
# 
#    date or date-sent
#    date-received
#    from
#    mailbox-order (unsorted)
#    score
#    size
#    subject
#    threads
#    to
# 
# You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: set sort=reverse-date-sent).
# 
# 
 set sort_alias=alias
#
# Name: sort_alias
# Type: sort order
# Default: alias
# 
# 
# Specifies how the entries in the `alias' menu are sorted.  The
# following are legal values:
# 
#    address (sort alphabetically by email address)
#    alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
#    unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)
# 
# 
 set sort_aux=threads
#
# Name: sort_aux
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
# 
# 
# When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
# in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
# are sorted.  This can be set to any value that ``$sort'' can, except
# threads (in that case, mutt will just use date-sent).  You can also
# specify the last- prefix in addition to the reverse- prefix, but last-
# must come after reverse-.  The last- prefix causes messages to be
# sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
# the rest of sort_aux as an ordering.  For instance, set sort_aux=last-
# date-received would mean that if a new message is received in a
# thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
# you have set sort=reverse-threads.) Note: For reversed ``$sort''
# order $sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
# but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).
# 
# 
 set sort_browser=unsorted
#
# Name: sort_browser
# Type: sort order
# Default: subject
# 
# 
# Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.  By default, the
# entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:
# 
#    alpha (alphabetically)
#    date
#    size
#    unsorted
# 
# You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: set sort_browser=reverse-date).
# 
# 
# set sort_re=yes
#
# Name: sort_re
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
# ``$strict_threads'' unset.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
# mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With sort_re set, mutt will
# only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
# the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
# setting of ``$reply_regexp''.  With sort_re unset, mutt will attach
# the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
# non-``$reply_regexp'' parts of both messages are identical.
# 
# 
 set spoolfile="$HOME/Maildir/"
#
# Name: spoolfile
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot find
# it, you can specify its location with this variable.  Mutt will
# automatically set this variable to the value of the environment
# variable $MAIL if it is not set.
# 
# 
# set status_chars="-*%A"
#
# Name: status_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "-*%A"
# 
# 
# Controls the characters used by the "%r" indicator in
# ``$status_format''. The first character is used when the mailbox is
# unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox has been changed, and
# it needs to be resynchronized. The third is used if the mailbox is in
# read-only mode, or if the mailbox will not be written when exiting
# that mailbox (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
# with the toggle-write operation, bound by default to "%"). The fourth
# is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened in attach-
# message mode (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying,
# forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).
# 
# 
 set status_format="-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"
#
# Name: status_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"
# 
# 
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the index
# menu.  This string is similar to ``$index_format'', but has its own
# set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %b      number of mailboxes with new mail *
# %d      number of deleted messages *
# %h      local hostname
# %f      the full pathname of the current mailbox
# %F      number of flagged messages *
# %l      size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *
# %L      size (in bytes) of the messages shown 
#         (i.e., which match the current limit) *
# %m      the number of messages in the mailbox *
# %M      the number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *
# %n      number of new messages in the mailbox *
# %o      number of old unread messages
# %p      number of postponed messages *
# %P      percentage of the way through the index
# %r      modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-message indicator,
#         according to $status_chars
# %s      current sorting mode ($sort)
# %S      current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
# %t      number of tagged messages *
# %u      number of unread messages *
# %v      Mutt version string
# %V      currently active limit pattern, if any *
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with "X"
# 
# 
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero
# 
# Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
# if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
# number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
# particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
# of the above sequences, the following construct is used
# 
# %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?
# 
# where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and
# optional_string is the string you would like printed if
# status_char is nonzero.  optional_string may contain
# other sequence as well as normal text, but you may not nest
# optional strings.
# 
# Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
# new messages in a mailbox:
# %?n?%n new messages.?
# 
# Additionally you can switch between two strings, the first one, if a
# value is zero, the second one, if the value is nonzero, by using the
# following construct:
# %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?
# 
# You can additionally force the result of any printf-like sequence to
# be lowercase by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore
# (_) sign.  For example, if you want to display the local hostname in
# lowercase, you would use:
# %_h
# 
# 
# set status_on_top=no
#
# Name: status_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable causes the ``status bar'' to be displayed on
# the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom.
# 
# 
# set strict_threads=no
#
# Name: strict_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, threading will only make use of the ``In-Reply-To'' and
# ``References'' fields when you ``$sort'' by message threads.  By
# default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
# ``pseudo threads.''  This may not always be desirable, such as in a
# personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
# the subject ``hi'' which will get grouped together.
# 
# 
# set suspend=yes
#
# Name: suspend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, mutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
# susp key, usually ``control-Z''. This is useful if you run mutt
# inside an xterm using a command like xterm -e mutt.
# 
# 
# set text_flowed=no
#
# Name: text_flowed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will generate text/plain; format=flowed attachments.
# This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
# just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's 
# features, you'll need support in your editor.
# 
# Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is set.
# 
# 
# set thread_received=no
#
# Name: thread_received
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
# to thread messages by subject.
# 
# 
# set thorough_search=no
#
# Name: thorough_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in
# section ``patterns'' above.  If set, the headers and attachments of
# messages to be searched are decoded before searching.  If unset,
# messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
# 
# 
 set tilde=yes
#
# Name: tilde
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
# screen with a tilde (~).
# 
# 
# set timeout=600
#
# Name: timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 600
# 
# 
# This variable controls the number of seconds Mutt will wait for
# a key to be pressed in the main menu before timing out and checking
# for new mail.  A value of zero or less will cause Mutt not to ever
# time out.
# 
# 
 set tmpdir="/tmp"
#
# Name: tmpdir
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its
# temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.
# 
# 
# set to_chars=" +TCFL"
#
# Name: to_chars
# Type: string
# Default: " +TCFL"
# 
# 
# Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.  The
# first character is the one used when the mail is NOT addressed to your
# address (default: space).  The second is used when you are the only
# recipient of the message (default: +).  The third is when your address
# appears in the TO header field, but you are not the only recipient of
# the message (default: T).  The fourth character is used when your
# address is specified in the CC header field, but you are not the only
# recipient.  The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent
# by you.  The sixth character is used to indicate when a mail
# was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to (default: L).
# 
# 
# set tunnel=""
#
# Name: tunnel
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a command
# instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
# preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3 server. Example:
# 
# tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"
# 
# NOTE: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
# machine without having to enter a password.
# 
# 
# set use_8bitmime=no
#
# Name: use_8bitmime
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Warning: do not set this variable unless you are using a version
# of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail
# 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
# 
# When set, Mutt will invoke ``$sendmail'' with the -B8BITMIME
# flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.
# 
# 
# set use_domain=yes
#
# Name: use_domain
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
# @host portion) with the value of ``$hostname''.  If unset, no
# addresses will be qualified.
# 
# 
# set use_from=yes
#
# Name: use_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will generate the `From:' header field when
# sending messages.  If unset, no `From:' header field will be
# generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the ``my_hdr''
# command.
# 
# 
# set use_ipv6=yes
#
# Name: use_ipv6
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
# contact.  If this option is unset, Mutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
# Normally, the default should work.
# 
# 
 set user_agent=yes
#
# Name: user_agent
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will add a "User-Agent" header to outgoing
# messages, indicating which version of mutt was used for composing
# them.
# 
# 
# set visual=""
#
# Name: visual
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the ~v command is
# given in the builtin editor.
# 
# 
# set wait_key=yes
#
# Name: wait_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after shell-
# escape, pipe-message, pipe-entry, print-message,
# and print-entry commands.
# 
# It is also used when viewing attachments with ``auto_view'', provided
# that the corresponding mailcap entry has a needsterminal flag,
# and the external program is interactive.
# 
# When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When unset, Mutt will wait
# for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.
# 
# 
# set weed=yes
#
# Name: weed
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will weed headers when when displaying, forwarding,
# printing, or replying to messages.
# 
# 
# set wrap_search=yes
#
# Name: wrap_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
