# nicer reading

set newsrc= "~/.newsrc"
# File where are stored the information about newsgroups

#set nntp_ask_followup=no
# If set, Mutt-ng will prompt you for the Followup-To:  header field
# before editing the body of an outgoing news article.

#set nntp_ask_x_comment_to=no
# If set, Mutt-ng will prompt you for the X-Comment-To:  header field

# as read when you leaving it.

set followup_to_poster=no
# If this variable is set and the keyword "poster" is present in the
# Followup-To: header field, a follow-up to the newsgroup is not
# permitted. The message will be mailed to the submitter of the message
# via mail.

#set group_index_format="%4C %M%N %5s %-45.45f %d"
set group_index_format="%4C %N %5s %-45.45f %d"
# This variable allows you to customize the newsgroup browser display to
# your personal taste. This string is similar to ``index_format'', but
# has its own set of printf(3)-like sequences:

# %C      current newsgroup number
# %d      description of newsgroup (retrieved from server)
# %f      newsgroup name
# %M      ``-'' if newsgroup not allowed for direct post (moderated for example)
# %N      ``N'' if newsgroup is new, ``u'' if unsubscribed, blank otherwise
# %n      number of new articles in newsgroup
# %s      number of unread articles in newsgroup
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"

#set inews=""
# If set, specifies the program and arguments used to deliver news
# posted by Mutt-ng. Otherwise, Mutt-ng posts article using current
# connection.

#set mime_subject=yes
# If unset, an 8-bit ``Subject:'' header field in a news article will
# not be encoded according to RFC2047.
# Note: Only change this setting if you know what you are doing.

#set news_cache_dir="~/.muttng"
# This variable points to directory where Mutt-ng will cache news
# article headers. If unset, headers will not be saved at all and will
# be reloaded each time when you enter a newsgroup.
# As for the header caching in connection with IMAP and/or Maildir, this
# drastically increases speed and lowers traffic.

#set news_server=""
# This variable specifies the name (or address) of the NNTP server to be
# used.  It defaults to the value specified via the environment variable
# $NNTPSERVER or contained in the file /etc/nntpserver.
# You can also specify a username and an alternative port for each
# newsserver, e.g.
# [nntp[s]://][username[:password]@]newsserver[:port]

#set nntp_mail_check=0
# The time in seconds until any operations on a newsgroup except posting
# a new article will cause a recheck for new news. If set to 0, Mutt-ng
# will recheck on each operation in index (stepping, read article,
# etc.).

#set post_moderated=ask-yes
# If set to yes, Mutt-ng will post articles to newsgroup that have not
# permissions to post (e.g. moderated).
# Note: if the newsserver does not support posting to that newsgroup or
# a group is totally read-only, that posting will not have any effect.

set save_unsubscribed=yes
# When set, info about unsubscribed newsgroups will be saved into the
# ``newsrc'' file and into the news cache.

#set show_new_news=yes
# If set, the newsserver will be asked for new newsgroups on entering
# the browser. Otherwise, it will be done only once for a newsserver.
# Also controls whether or not the number of new articles of subscribed
# newsgroups will be checked.

set show_only_unread=yes
# If set, only subscribed newsgroups that contain unread articles will
# be displayed in the newsgroup browser.

set x_comment_to=yes
# If set, Mutt-ng will add a ``X-Comment-To:'' header field (that
# contains full name of the original article author) to articles that
# you followup to.

#set agent_string=yes
# When set, Mutt-ng will add a ``User-Agent:'' header to outgoing
# messages, indicating which version of Mutt-ng was used for composing
# them.
